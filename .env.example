# Report files
# ---------------------------

# they'll be resolved under this directory. In GitLab jobs, artifacts are

# ---------------------------

# - link:    Embed with link buttons only

# - both:    Embed with summary + buttons (recommended)
# - plain:   Plain text content (no embed; buttons still possible)

# ---------------------------
